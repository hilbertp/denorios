## The Team

The Liberation of Bajor is an AI agent orchestration pipeline. One human (Philipp) works with a team of AI roles, each in its own Cowork session window.

    L[Leeta — Frontend Implementor]
    N[Nog — Code Reviewer]
    B[Bashir — QA]

```

Philipp (yellow) is the only human. All blue nodes are AI roles running in separate Cowork windows or Claude Code sessions.

## Role Folder Structure

Every role has a folder at `repo/.claude/roles/{role-name}/` with a consistent layout:

```
roles/
├── sisko/
│   ├── ROLE.md          ← Identity, responsibilities, decision rights
│   ├── LEARNING.md      ← Cross-project behavioral memory
│   └── inbox/           ← Incoming handoffs and responses
│       ├── HANDOFF-BET2-REQUIREMENTS.md
│       └── RESPONSE-ARCHITECTURE-FROM-DAX.md
├── dax/
│   ├── ROLE.md
│   ├── LEARNING.md
│   └── inbox/
│       └── ...
├── obrien/
│   ├── ROLE.md
│   ├── LEARNING.md
│   └── inbox/
│       └── ...
└── ... (ziyal, leeta, nog, bashir)
```

**Three zones, one purpose each:**

| File/Folder | Purpose | Who writes it |
|---|---|---|
| `ROLE.md` | Identity — what this role is, what it decides | Sisko or Philipp |
| `LEARNING.md` | Memory — behavioral patterns learned across sessions | The role itself |
| `inbox/` | Work queue — incoming handoffs and responses from other roles | Other roles (via `/handoff-to-teammate`) |

## How Work Flows Between Roles

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Sisko (PM)
    participant D as Dax (Architect)
    participant K as O'Brien (Delivery)
    participant R as Rom (Implementor)
    participant N as Nog (Review)
    participant B as Bashir (QA)

    S->>D: HANDOFF → dax/inbox/
    Note over D: Reads inbox, does architecture work
    D->>K: HANDOFF → obrien/inbox/
    D->>R: Context → slice file
    Note over D: (Architecture informs slicing and implementation)
    K->>R: STAGED brief → bridge/staged/
    Note over R: Watcher picks up approved brief automatically
    R->>K: DONE report → bridge/queue/
    R->>N: Review handoff via watcher
    N->>B: Regression gate before merge
    alt Accepted
        B->>K: Merge branch to main
    else Amendment needed
        K->>R: New STAGED brief (amendment)
    end
```

**Key rule:** Every role-to-role communication is a file. If it's not written down in the receiver's `inbox/`, it didn't happen.

## Session Lifecycle

Every role session follows the same pattern: start up, check inbox, work, wrap up.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Start Session] --> B[Read TEAM-STANDARDS.md]
    B --> C[Read ROLE.md + LEARNING.md]
    C --> D[Run /check-handoffs]
    D --> E{T&T gap?}
    E -->|Yes| F[Log missing hours first]
    E -->|No| G[Check inbox/ for work]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Do the work]
    H --> I[Run /wrap-up]
    I --> J[End Session]

    style A fill:#4CAF50,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style J fill:#f44336,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style I fill:#ff9800,stroke:#333,color:#fff
    style D fill:#ff9800,stroke:#333,color:#fff
```

### Session Start: `/check-handoffs`

1. **T&T self-audit** — checks `bridge/tt-audit.jsonl` for your last outbound handoff, then checks `bridge/timesheet.jsonl` for a matching timesheet entry after that timestamp. If missing, warns you to log hours before proceeding.
2. **Inbox scan** — lists all `HANDOFF-*.md` and `RESPONSE-*.md` in your `inbox/` folder, newest first.

### Session End: `/wrap-up`

Five steps, in order:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    W1[1. Capture Learnings] --> W2[2. Estimate Hours]
    W2 --> W3[3. Record Token Cost]
    W3 --> W4[4. Idea Checkpoint]
    W4 --> W5[5. Stamp Anchor]

    W1 -.- L1[LEARNING.md + DEBRIEF.md]
    W2 -.- L2[bridge/timesheet.jsonl]
    W3 -.- L3[usage-snapshot.js or manual]
    W4 -.- L4[IDEAS.md]
    W5 -.- L5[bridge/anchors.jsonl]
```

**Why this matters:** AI sessions start fresh. Context compaction destroys the texture of work — what was tried, how long it took, what surprised you. Wrap-up captures this into durable files while the details still exist. Run it before the session ends, not after.

---

## The Handoff Protocol

When one role needs something from another role, they run `/handoff-to-teammate`. This does four things automatically:

1. **Writes the artifact** — a markdown file in the receiver's `inbox/`
2. **Logs economics** — one timesheet entry for all work done this session
3. **Stamps an anchor** — a marker in `bridge/anchors.jsonl` so the reporting agent knows where to start
4. **Reports to the user** — tells Philipp which role to open next

### Artifact naming

| Type | Pattern | Example |
|---|---|---|
| Handoff | `inbox/HANDOFF-{description}.md` | `obrien/inbox/HANDOFF-BET3-SLICING.md` |
| Response | `inbox/RESPONSE-{description}-FROM-{role}.md` | `sisko/inbox/RESPONSE-ARCHITECTURE-FROM-DAX.md` |

### Routing rules

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    Q{What kind of work?}
    Q -->|Scope/priority decision| S[Sisko]
    Q -->|Technical architecture| D[Dax]
    Q -->|Sequence/brief/split| K[O'Brien]
    Q -->|Backend build| R[Rom]
    Q -->|Frontend/landing| L[Leeta]
    Q -->|UI/UX design| Z[Ziyal]
    Q -->|Code review| N[Nog]
    Q -->|QA/testing| B[Bashir]

    D -->|Architecture output| K2[O'Brien + Rom context]
    Note1[O'Brien keeps slice discipline] -.- K2

    style Note1 fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#856404,color:#856404
```

**Rule of thumb:** Technical work always goes to Dax before O'Brien turns it into slices. Rom should never receive raw technical requirements without O'Brien's slice framing.

## Economics Tracking

Every role logs time after completing significant work. Two halves of the equation:

| Metric | What it measures | Where it's logged |
|---|---|---|
| **Human hours** | What a competent human professional would bill for this work | `bridge/timesheet.jsonl` |
| **Token cost** | What the AI session actually cost in tokens/euros | `bridge/timesheet.jsonl` (via `usage-snapshot.js`) |

Together these give ROI: value created (human hours saved) vs. cost incurred (token spend).

### Timesheet entry (one per deliverable)

```json
{
  "ts": "2026-04-12T19:30:00Z",
  "role": "obrien",
  "deliverable": "bet3-ops-center-polish",
  "phase": "fix",
  "brief_id": null,
  "task": "Fixed Ops history table...",
  "human_hours": 3.0,
  "human_role": "Senior Developer",
  "actual_minutes": 45,
  "notes": "Explanation of the estimate..."
}
```

### Automated tracking (Rom's sessions)

The watcher tracks Rom's token burn automatically — it captures `tokens_in`, `tokens_out`, and `cost_usd` from Claude Code's JSON output and writes them to `bridge/register.jsonl`.

### Manual tracking (Cowork role sessions)

Cowork roles (Dax, O'Brien, Sisko, Ziyal, Leeta) are invisible to the watcher. Their token cost is captured by `bridge/usage-snapshot.js`, which reads the Claude desktop app's usage API. This runs at session start (`/check-handoffs`) and session end (`/wrap-up` or `/handoff-to-teammate`).

## Skills Reference

Global skills every role has access to:

| Skill | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `/check-handoffs` | Session start, "check inbox" | T&T self-audit + inbox scan |
| `/handoff-to-teammate` | Passing work to another role | Write artifact + log economics + stamp anchor |
| `/wrap-up` | Session end, "wrap up" | Learnings + hours + cost + ideas + anchor |
| `/estimate-hours` | After completing work | Append timesheet entry |
| `/debrief` | When something is learned | Write to LEARNING.md or DEBRIEF.md |
| `/idea-capture` | When a future feature idea surfaces | Append to IDEAS.md |
